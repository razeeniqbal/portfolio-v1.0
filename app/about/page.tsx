            <p className="text-sm">
              My journey started in civil engineering, but I discovered my passion for data and AI during 
              my time at G&P Geotechnic, where I automated engineering workflows and built data solutions. 
              That spark led me to become a Certified Data Analyst and pursue a Master's in Artificial Intelligence,
              and I haven't looked back since.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm">
              Now as a Data Engineer at AEM Energy Solutions, I work on building data pipelines, moving data 
              between different systems, and creating smart analytics tools for the energy sector. Before this, 
              at EISmartwork, I built prediction models using massive datasets with over 10 million records and 
              created interactive dashboards that helped companies make better decisions 20% faster.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm">
              I hold a Master's degree in AI from {personalInfo.university} with a CGPA of {personalInfo.cgpa}, 
              and I've earned certifications from big tech companies like Microsoft, Google Cloud, and IBM. I was 
              invited as a Google Speaker to talk about AI at AI Build 2025, and made it to the Top 20 
              in AWS National 2025 for training large language models.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm">
              What drives me? Turning messy data into clear insights, building systems that learn and improve, 
              and staying ahead in the fast-moving world of AI. Whether it's designing data workflows, training 
              smart models, or creating visual dashboards, I'm passionate about solving tough problems that make 
              a real difference.
